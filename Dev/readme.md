# Unium Dev
> This folder contains tests and utility scripts used for development on the unium library


## Requirements

## Philosophy

#### It should just work

You should not have to modify you game in any way in order to automate it.

#### It should work for game developers

It should fit with game developer ways of working.

The intended audience is game developers first and technical testers second. It should not compromise their experience with other considerations.

#### It should not lock you into a specific language or framework

You should be able to write your automation and test scripts in any language or framework you choose. Unium should come with no dependencies or stipulations.

#### It should be open source

Both in spirit and practice.
